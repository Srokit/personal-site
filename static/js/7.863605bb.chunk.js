I am working on the ContextHub Runtime Environment and Sensors team in the greater Android team. I do lots of different things on a day to day basis: a little bit of embedded C++, a little bit of python scripting, a lot of tricky debugging work. I work with a large code base and a large (and super nice) team.\n\n# Recent Past\n\nBefore working at Google I worked for ServiceNow as an engineering intern. It was my first bay area job so I was super stoked. I worked with a team of interns to prototype a application that would help ServiceNow's clients track the usage and upsell potential of their own customers. We built the app using react and a custom server side framework.\n________\nBefore that I worked a summer at Nexteer Automotive where I built an Android application that allows other engineers to collect diagnostic data about the car part under test. I was also briefly exposed to C# scripting.\n_______\nSince the summer after my sophomore year of college, I worked for the Computer-Aided Engineering Network at the Univeristy of Michigan. I started by building a few dashboards for them using the elasticsearch framework to track stats about computer lab usage. Over the remainder of my time I worked on flask web apps that managed internal processes for the staff of the College of Engineering.\n\n# Ancient History\n\nI was born in Dallas, TX but raised in Saginaw, MI. I'm the youngest of 5 kids.\n_______\nI have been coding since I was about 13 when I found out that you can make video games on your computer. So naturally I copied python pygame scripts onto my computer and ran them myself (which blew my mind that it actually worked the same way I saw in the youtube video).\n_______\nThroughout high school I kept coding as a hobby and checked out lots of other languages and started and stopped lots of ideas. Some of those are still on my github. Summer before senior year of high school I went to a coding camp at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago where I learned PHP and web development for the first time and got to visit lots of tech offices in the city. Senior year of high school I convinced my academic advisor to let me do a self guided AP Computer Science class since we didn't have one.\n______\nI started undergrad at the University of Michigan where I didn't have much trouble picking CS as a major (wish I could say the same for finishing it).\nI met lots of friends and learned a lot. I Was challenged through mostly hands on project based learning and coded many lines of C++.\n\n# Fun Facts\n\n- I will show you where anything is in Michigan by pointing to my hand.\n- I once called myself \"smart\" Stan when asked to come up with an alliteration of my name as an ice breaker (super humble).\n- I sometimes bob my head to music coming out of my headphones in public settings.\n- Apples are my favorite food/meal/anything.\n\n# Hobbies\n\n- [Music Production](https://soundcloud.com/user-392567663)\n- Guitar\n- Basketball\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,l=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(i.b,Object(a.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Stan Rokita",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(r.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
